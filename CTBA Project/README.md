**Exploratory Data Analysis**
Finding what happened with cheese consumption before and during the paandemic.There are higher spikes on the gold lines indicating an increase in the year 2021 of  the quantity of cheese sold and which indicates an increase in consumption of cheese during covid as compared to pre-covid.
Made a visual presentation as shown below Indicating the cheese shipped against cheese not shipped to look at supply of cheese against labour shortages.The spike, highlighted, coincides with the period when the CDC mandates were first enacted, leading to significant disruptions in production and distribution. This shortage had a ripple effect throughout the entire supply chain, further delaying shipments and reducing availability at retail levels.


We made a visual presentation of the total orders and found a decrease in the order amounts based on the timeline of the dry ice shortage.Take a look at  the frequencies in yellow that are  indicating a drop in total orders after shortages. It is important to note that the decrease in total orders did  not take place at the start of the pandemic but instead aligned with the manufacturing of the vaccine around the start of 2021.

You can see some spikes in supply sold around the holiday season which is always expected due to holiday parties, etc.
But look over to Christmas 2021. What an incredible jump in cheese sold. You see, this was the first holiday season after the start of vaccine requirements and the lifting of mask mandates
