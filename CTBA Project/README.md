**The Cheese Market**

**Overview**

This project aims to comprehensively analyze retail data within the “Cheese” category across four major grocery retailers. Spanning approximately 1,200 stores and including data from the COVID-19 years, the project seeks to understand demand and supply dynamics during a period of significant disruption. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights and recommendations based on the provided data and independent research, helping to understand customer behavior better and to build supply chain resilience. Utilized three datasets.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Analyzing Consumption before, during and after the pandemic**

Finding what happened with cheese consumption before and during the paandemic.There are higher spikes on the gold lines indicating an increase in the year 2021 of  the quantity of cheese sold and which indicates an increase in consumption of cheese during covid as compared to pre-covid.

**Analysis of Labour Shortage**

If we look at this graph, you can see the supply of cheese that was not being shipped. The spike, highlighted, coincides with the period when the CDC mandates were first enacted, leading to significant disruptions in production and distribution. This shortage had a ripple effect throughout the entire supply chain, further delaying shipments and reducing availability at retail levels.

**Analyzing Dry ice shortages**

You see, dry ice was needed to safely store and ship these vaccinations. But the dairy industry is actually a huge consumer of dry ice. Dry ice is essential in making dairy cultures and in shipping and storing these products.You can see on this graph here how greatly the supply of cheese was affected by the shortage of dry ice.

**Cyber Attack Analysis**

In 2022, a major cybersecurity attack on Saputo Cheese USA, a leading Wisconsin cheese manufacturer, caused severe disruptions in operations, resulting in a significant cheese shortage that lasted through November of that year. The attack compromised critical systems, halting production and delaying shipments for weeks

**Total Order Analysis**

We made a visual presentation of the total orders and found a decrease in the order amounts based on the timeline of the dry ice shortage.Take a look at  the frequencies in yellow that are  indicating a drop in total orders after shortages. It is important to note that the decrease in total orders did  not take place at the start of the pandemic but instead aligned with the manufacturing of the vaccine around the start of 2021.

**Analysis of price paid**

We analyzed price retailer paid per cheese  and we found that the prices during covid were not very volatile and they mostly only increased during inflation. In June 2020, dairy prices rebounded sharply, after increasing 24.5 percent. Higher input costs, coupled with low inventories and cold storage stocks, had pushed cheese prices dramatically higher.

This contagious and easily spreadable virus caused our nation to completely shut down. A national lockdown order was set in place and people were to isolate and quarantine.As these people were forced to stay indoors to prevent the spread of the virus, home-cooking and comfort food consumption increased significantly. 
This gave rise to the demand for cheese products such as cream, cottage, and other specialty cheese to prepare a variety of cuisines.Consumers were buying food that was convenient and readily available. Prepared sandwiches, salads, and other similar products.Around the time of the lockdown, we can see these spikes in cheese consumption and sales.

Take a look at this graph. You can see some spikes in supply sold around the holiday season which is always expected due to holiday parties.But look over to Christmas 2021. What an incredible jump in cheese sold. You see, this was the first holiday season after the start of vaccine requirements and the lifting of mask mandates.

The cybersecurity attack on Saputo Cheese USA not only disrupted production but also triggered significant consumer behavior changes, including over-purchasing and bulk buying. As news of the supply issues spread, consumers rushed to stockpile cheese, leading to a 30% increase in purchases per household and a 20% spike in demand, according to the Food Marketing Institute and IDFA. This panic buying caused empty shelves and exacerbated the supply shortage, driving cheese prices up by as much as 15%. These trends highlight how consumer behavior can dramatically impact market dynamics during crises.

**Conclusion**

These instances such as the dry ice and labor shortages that halted cheese shipments were incredibly wasteful.
Cows don’t stop making milk so there’s no halt in supply, only overflow & waste.Our group wanted to find ways for dairy farms to stop this waste the next time something like a pandemic halts the distribution of product.We need to find ways to export this product locally when national shipment isn’t an option.
We could bring back the milkman and do door-to-door contactless milk deliveries. Donate extra product to homeless shelters, local food shelters, and community kitchens. Dairy farmers can also repurpose this product into things for the farm such as livestock feed and compost for their crops.When dry ice isn’t an option, coolers and ice can keep these products cold and safe when transporting locally.There are many ways we can stay sustainable and prevent product waste.
